cardTest1 had two failures when testing adventurer. They both returned incorrect counts for cards. This caused me to look into the code and I discovered that the drawntreasure for() loop had been modified to pick up 1 too many treasure cards. This needs to be fixed to be <2, not <3.

randomTestAdventurer failed due to the same bug. It reported failure of all 2000 randomly generated tests.

randomTestCard1 failed to pass all randomly generated tests of Council_Room. Again, card counts were off and in investigating the method, I found that the for() loop used to draw cards for the current player had been changed from <4 to <=4. Therefore 1 too many cards were drawn.

randomTestCard2 failed to pass all randomly generated tests of Smithy. This was also due to card counts, as the drawcard for() loop had been changed from <3 to <4.
