/*
In order to randomly test this function, I created a function that randomly returns all possible
legitimate values for the characters that are being tested and included 1 illegitmate character
just to make sure an unanticipated result wouldn't cause a problem.

Then I created a function to return a random string. It is composed of an array of possible strings,
one of which is the string necessary to set off the error message. This function will randomly
return one of the given strings.
